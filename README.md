To cap off our first year of front-end development, we were tasked with a final project that incorporates all the skills we've learned so far. Unlike previous projects, this one also includes JavaScript and API integration.

## Description

The client, broken down:
- Name: HotView Labs
- Sector: Tech Research and Development
- Size: 30 employees
- Location: Worldwide
- Mission: Provide the most accurate and up to date insights to tech leaders across the world.

The project brief, broken down:
- Build a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging application.
- Ensure the design is responsive and displays dynamic blog posts.
- Include admin pages for registering, logging in, and managing blog posts.
- CSS and JS frameworks are not permitted.
- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exclusively.

User stories to guide the design:
As a user:
- I want to see an interactive banner carousel on the blog feed page.
- I want to click on a button for each carousel item, taking me to the blog post page to read more.
- I want to click on the previous or next button in the carousel to animate and reveal another post.
- I want the carousel to return to the first post after reaching the end of the list.
- I want to view a static list of the 12 latest posts in a responsive thumbnail grid on the blog feed page.
- I want each thumbnail in the blog post feed to be clickable.
- I want to see a responsive layout showing the post title, author, publication date, image banner, and post content from the API.
- I want each blog page to have a shareable URL including a query string or hash parameter that contains the post ID.

As the owner:
- I want the blog post edit page to be available only for me when logged in.
- I want a delete button that sends a DELETE request to the API for this post ID on the edit page.
- I want a validated edit form that allows me to update the title, body content, or image by sending a POST request to the API for this post ID.
- I want a validated login form that allows me to request and save a token to my browser by entering my email and password.
- I want a validated register form that allows me to create a new account by entering my name.

Sitemap:
- /index.html (Blog Feed Page)
- /post/index.html (Blog Post Public Page)
- /post/edit.html (Blog Post Edit Page)
- /account/login.html (Account Login Page)
- /account/register.html (Account Register Page)

The goal of this project was to showcase everything we have learned in the first year of the FED1 program. It served as an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to interpret a brief and deliver a polished final product.
